# Hello-World
Version control lab
name = input("Enter your name here:")

heightinInches = input("Enter your height in inches here: ")

heightinFeet = int(heightinInches)/12
remainderInches = int(heightinInches)%12

print ("Your name is, ", name ,"and your height is ", int(heightinFeet) ,"feet and", remainderInches ,"inches.")

That is the program. I will upload it to GitHub when I find out how.
